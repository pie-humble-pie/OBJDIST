# android-object-distance
Android sample app which provides distance of an object from the camera; using contour based image recognition through OpenCV. This project is avilable on google play store as an example.

- Place an object with a highlighted boundry in front of your phone. 
- Take a picture and enter its initial ditance and length of its perimeter, all in centimeters. 
- Now move the phone some distance away and take the picture again. 
- A distance, from phone to object, will be displayed.
- Approx. error ~2cm.

Tested on Nexus 5.
