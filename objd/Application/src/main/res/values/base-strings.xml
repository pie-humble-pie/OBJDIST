            This sample demonstrates a contour based algorithm for distance detection from camera to object.
            Take the first picture to calibrate to fix focal length of camera; provide distance
            to object and perimeter length of the object in the pop-up dialog that follows.
            The next picture you take will provide distance of that object to the camera.
            The pictures will be stored in "/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.example.android.camera2basic/files/".
